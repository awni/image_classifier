							One of the most exciting recent developments in machine learning is the ability of agents to learn how to represent
							the world without supervision. It is particularly interesting when the learned representations are similar to the way our brains process
							information as it seems like a step in the direction of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_AI">strong AI</a>.

						<p>
							In this assignment you are going to implement a cutting edge algorithm that will learn a feature representation of images
							analogous to the human visual cortex. Using these "features" your program will then classify the content of images
							in the <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">CIFAR-10</a> dataset.

							This project, like most python machine learning projects, uses numpy and matplot lib. We wrote an install script that makes it

							<pre>python install.py</pre>
							If for some reason you have trouble installing the packages, let us know and we can

					</div>
					
					<p>Now lets see how images are stored. Each image is a 32 by 32 square (yes, they are small). 
					Images are broken down into sixteen "patches" each of which is 8 by 8. </p>

					<p>You can get the patches of an image by calling getPatches on your image. </p>
						<pre>patches = firstImage.getPatches()</pre>
					<p>Patches in our data set are simple! 
					They are lists of 64 positive or negative floating point numbers (one entry for each of the 64 pixels in the patch). Lets print one out:</p>
					
<pre>len(patches)
firstPatch = patches[0]
len(firstPatch)
firstPatch
</pre>

					<p>We got these numbers by transforming 
					pixels in a similar way to how the human eye sees light. Negative numbers are for when 
					the eye sees a dark pixel and positive numbers are for when the eye sees a light pixel. A computer trying to learn airplanes vs birds using
						these raw "features" will <b>not</b> be able to accurately recognize the difference between birds and planes. The patch
						representation is too low level.</p>

					<!--<p>

					<p>
						<a href ="#ulearn">Unsupervised Learning</a>: Implement K-means to learn K centroids for image patches. These patches are small contiguous regions of the training set of images (Fig 2).

The feature extraction creates features for each patch of an image (Fig 2) using the K centroids from part 1.  The full feature representation for an image is then the feature representations for all of its patches.
					</p>
					<p>
						<a href ="#slearn">Supervised Learning</a>: Use the extracted features from part 2 in a logistic regression classifier.  You'll use Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to learn the parameters of the classifier, which will be optimized with Batch Gradient Descent.

					<div class="subsection">
						<p>A simple yet powerful insight in 2012 was that an unsupervised agent can learn feature representations based on centroids 
							of structured subsections of the training data. In this part of the assignment you will implement K-means clustering to learn 
							centroids for image <b>patches</b>.  Specifically you should fill out the method 
							<code>runKmeans</code> in the file
							<code>featureLearner.py</code>.

								Figure 4: 20 centroids learned from K-means on patches from the first 1000 training images. Notice that the centroids look like edges!
							</p>
						</center>
						


						<p>
							Since each of our image patches are 64 floating point numbers, the centroids that K-means finds will also be 64 floating point numbers.
							We start you off by initializing K-means with random centroids where each floating point number is chosen from a normal distribution with mean 0 
							and standard devation 1. </p>
						<p>
							In order to determine if K-means has converged, calculate and print the error after each iteration. 
							The error for k-means is defined as the sum of squared <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance#Squared_Euclidean_distance">euclidean distances</a> of each training patch to its closest centroid.
						</p>
						<p style="font-size:20px">
							<center>
								$$ Error = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \|x^{(i)}-\text{Centroid}(x^{(i)})\|_2^2 $$
							</center>
						</p>
						<p>
							Where $m$ is the number of patches, $x^{(i)}$ is the $i$th patch and $\text{Centroid}(x^{(i)})$ is the centroid that the $i$th patch is assigned to after the most recent iteration.
						</p>
						<p>
							Test the K-means code with the provided test utility in
							<code>
								evaluator.py
							</code>
							by running: 							<pre>python evaluator.py -k -t</pre>
						</p>
						<p>
							If you've passed the test above, try running your K-means method with a bigger dataset.  After 50 iterations of K-means with the first 1000 training images and 25 centroids, our error is 807,189.
							You should be able to get the same results by running the
							<code>
								evaluator
							</code>
							and seeding the random number generator with the
							<code>
								-f
							</code>
							flag. Even if you do not run k-means with a fixed seed, you should get similar error.
							
							<pre>python evaluator.py -k -f</pre>							
		   


						<p>
							Another way to determine if your K-means algorithm is learning sensible features is to view the learned centroids using our provided 
							utility function.  To view the first 20 learned centroids, run 							
							
							<pre>python evaluator.py -k -f -v</pre>
							
							
							Your centroids should look similar to Fig 4. Notice how the centroids resemble edges. Thats particularly interesting because the first layer of neurons in our visual cortex also detects edges.

						<p>How can we our patch centroids to generate features that will be more useful for the classification task then the raw pixel intensities we started out with? 
							The answer is to represent each patch by the distance to the  
							centroids that it most resembles.</p>
						<p>
							In this portion of the assignment you will implement the
							<code>extractFeatures</code>
							method in the
							<code>featureLearner.py</code>
							file.  This method takes one image object, and returns features for that image using the learned centroids.  
						</p>
						<p>
							There will be one feature for each patch, centroid combination which will be a representation of how similar the patch is
							to the centroid (see the exact definition below). Therefore, each image will have $16$x$K$ features where $16$ is the number of patches per image and $K$ is the number 
							of centroids learned in part 1.  </p>
							
							<p>The relative activation of centroid $j$ by patch $i$ ($a_{ij}$) is defined to be the average distance 
								from patch $i$ to all centroids minus the distance from $i$ to $j$. 
								
								<p style="font-size:50px">
							<center>
								$$ a_{ij} = \frac{\sum\limits_{c \in centroids}{\|i-c\|_2}}{K} - \|i-j\|_2 $$

						<p style="font-size:20px">

							Our final task is to use our better feature representation to classify images as birds or planes. You will implement both parts
							of the supervised learning pipeline: training (learning a hypothesis function) and testing (using your hypothesis function to make
							predictions)</p>
							
							<p>
							For this assignmnet you should write a logistic regression classifier using batch gradient descent. First fill out the method <code>train</code> in the file <code>classifier.py</code>
							to learn all the parameters you will need to make predictions. The images passed in to you will be in their original "raw" form. Make
							sure to use your <code>FeatureLearner</code> from the previous parts so that you can turn images into a higher level representation.

							Specifically, write a logistic regression classifier that does not use an intercept variable. Solve for the weights using
							a batch (standard) gradient descent update that minimizes the likelihood objective. You should not use a regularization term.</p>
			
						<p>In our solution, we initialize the weight vector from a zero-mean gaussian with 0.01 standard deviation.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can test your logistic regression classifier by running 							<pre>python evaluator.py -s</pre>

						<p>
							To save time in computation you can run a toy version of the full pipeline by passing
							<code>evaluator</code>
							the
							<code>-d</code>
							flag. 							<pre>python evaluator.py -d</pre>
						</p>

						<p>
							Run gradient descent for
							<code>self.maxIter = 5000</code>
							iterations before stopping.  After running gradient descent for 5000 iterations using only the first 1000 training images and a learning rate $\alpha=1e-5$, our negative log-likelihood evaluated to $400.8$.
						</p>

						<p>
							Next implement the
							<code>test</code>
							method in the
							<code>classifier.py</code>
							file.  This method takes as input a list of test
							<code>Image</code>
							objects and makes a prediction as to whether each image is a plane or a bird (0 or 1 respectively).

							One commonly held hypothesis is that humans process natural stimuli such as images in multiple layers of representation, 
							starting with the raw sensory stimulus and slowly building higher and higher levels of representation. 
							For example in human vision the raw sensory stimulus received in the retina is passed to a first layer of neurons 
							in the visual cortex. This first layer is hypothesized to have many neurons known as simple cells all of which code 
							for different features in the input. In particular, much evidence points to these simple cells as being edge detectors, 
							i.e. they each code for a specific edge of different orientation and translation within the image. 
							The new representation of what the eye sees becomes the activations of these simple cells which the next part of the brain 
							can turn into higher level understanding like: "I'm looking at a bird."
						</p>

						<p>
							The unsupervised algorithm you implemented was able to learn a feature representation of images similar to the first layer of 
							processing in the visual cortex. In other words, the algorithm wasn't told via supervision or hard coded in any other way 
							to learn to represent an image as it's component edges. Amazingly, that's what the agent found to be the most important features 
							in an image on its own! Unsuprisingly, since our features were similar to the human brain we were quite good at telling the 
							difference between birds and planes. This result suggests the AI community may be approaching an understanding 
							of the learning algorithm used by the human brain.

								Get classification accuracy high! We will give bonus points to student with best classification accuracy. Note all extra work should be done outside of existing functions in order to not mess up the autograder.  Report your best accuracy in your
								<code>
									README
								</code>
								.  We will run your code to verify this.
							</li>
							<li>
								Try out using a different linear classifier, such as a linear SVM, and report how it performs.
							</li>
							<li>
								Overfit the training data with many centroids and add a regularizer to your cost function to see if you can improve generalization error
							</li>
							<li>
								Anything else you can dream up!
